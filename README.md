# data_structs_cpp
Data structure practice in C++

ROAD MAP:

1. Implement HashTable<T>
2. Implement BinaryTree and associated algorithms
3. Implement 3-ary Tree and associated algorithms
4. Implement Graphs and associated algorithms

DISCLAIMERS:
This is purely a practice project that I am using to gain better knowledge of the C++ programming language and practice my data structures knowledge.

To anyone seeking to use this, please understand this is NOT intended for use outside of my own educational purposes, or as a quick fix to procrastinating on an assignment.
